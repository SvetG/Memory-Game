<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is a classic memory matching game created as a project for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program.</p>

<h2>Instructions<h2>
<p>To start the game click on any two cards.</p> 

The goal is to find two matching cards, in the shortest amount of time. There is an unlimited number of tries, however the game is timed. The timer starts when the first card is clicked and stops when the last match is found. 
A restart button can be pressed at any time in the game. The restart button reshuffles the deck, re-starts the timer, and replenishes the star rating. 

The star rating evaluates the players competency. The game starts with 5 stars. 1 star is deducted every 2 unsuccessful matches.

Each time a match is unsuccessful the cards flip back over. Successful matches stay open.
